Frever is a mobile avatar and content creation platform designed for expressive storytelling through custom 3D characters. Users could create avatars, style outfits, generate short-form video content, and engage in social interactions including chat and user feeds. Videos created with Frever were shared externally and accumulated over **10+ billion views** across platforms.

This open source release contains a curated collection of assets for the **Frever App‚Äôs avatar wardrobe system**, including customizable wardrobe elements and makeup features.

The project provides a mix of asset types such as:

- **UMA wardrobe files** for character customization

- **.fbx files** in some cases for mesh-based wardrobe assets

These assets are designed to enhance avatar expression and identity.
